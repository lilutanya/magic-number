## Task/Requirement

This simple HTTP service can be called with two numbers to produce a magic number:
http://apps.wavana.com/magicnumber?x=[any number]&y=[any number]

In a CommonJS compatible module, write an interface that would return the square root of this number to an asynchronous callback function. It must be able to handle multiple requests.

Write a simple script to test this module.
